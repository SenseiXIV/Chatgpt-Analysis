ChatGPT Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on user-generated ChatGPT reviews. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations to understand overall user sentiment and key opinion trends.

This project performs sentiment analysis on ChatGPT reviews using a complete NLP pipeline. The text data is first tokenized and lemmatized to normalize and prepare it for analysis. After preprocessing, sentiment labels are assigned and explored through multiple visualizations, including bar charts to compare sentiment distribution, line charts to observe trends over time, and a word map highlighting the most frequent terms. These visual insights help interpret patterns and understand user opinions more effectively.
